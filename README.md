# Authenticator — public portfolio showcase

## Technical documentation (current audit)

**Audit date:** 20 October 2026 · **Release classification:** not a verified complete production application.

**Current GitHub state:** Documentation only; a separately authored identity dashboard is not a production TOTP application.

**Source/stack evidence:** Canonical original source unverified. The prepared login Worker is access control for a showcase, **not** a TOTP/passkey authenticator.

**Cloudflare state:** The Pages project hosts an earlier documentation deployment. A site-specific Turnstile widget and a shared `AUTH_DB` D1 binding have been provisioned, but a working application deployment and admin sign-in have not been verified. Secret values must never be committed to this public repository.

**Engineering documentation:**

- **[Complete architecture, folder tree, languages, API contracts and backend connections](docs/TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md)**
- **[Features, actual implementation status and acceptance requirements](docs/FEATURE_AND_RELEASE_MATRIX.md)**
- **[Authentication, Turnstile, security controls, deployment and operations runbook](docs/SECURITY_AND_OPERATIONS.md)**
- [Source verification and NDA boundaries](docs/SOURCE_VERIFICATION.md)
- [Existing platform/device support notes](docs/DEVICE_PREVIEW.md)

All projects use the portfolio credit **[Developed and Designed by Jelvan®](https://portfolio.jelvan.pro)** for independently authored public work. This does not transfer ownership of third-party/client deliverables.

## Overview

A portfolio documentation shell for an authenticator app. It intentionally contains no working secret-generation logic, user recovery paths, or client-specific identity flows.

## Current evidence and status

**A similarly named auth repository was listed but not readable via the connected action; a separate public authentik fork is NOT evidence that it is the intended Authenticator project.**

This repository is **documentation-only**: it does not include an application build, genuine account access, production dependencies or a deployment artifact.

### What the source documentation supports

- Exact intended application source and ownership not established.
- Do not confuse a third-party authentik source tree with a custom authored authenticator app.

### Technology context

- Actual Authenticator application framework not verified
- Authentication protocols and storage mechanisms not verified

### Capabilities described or proposed

- Illustrative account setup screen — unverified
- Illustrative code or passkey UX — unverified
- Illustrative recovery and security UX — unverified

> **Accuracy rule:** Any item identified as illustrative, proposed, unverified, or source-documented must not be marketed as a live, completed feature.

## Architecture at a glance

```text
Concept only: device authenticator interface ↔ approved identity service; actual security architecture requires source verification
```

For component boundaries, implementation caveats and verification: [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [Implementation Notes](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Device previews

The portfolio can offer macOS, Desktop Web, iOS and Android **presentation modes**. That does not imply a native build exists on every platform.

| Viewer mode | Evidence-backed display type |
| --- | --- |
| macos | screenshot-placeholder |
| web | screenshot-placeholder |
| ios | screenshot-placeholder |
| android | screenshot-placeholder |

Read the [device preview policy](docs/DEVICE_PREVIEW.md) before enabling live framing. Public demo assets are intentionally absent until permission and sanitization checks are passed.

## Known limitations

- No statement of MFA standards compliance, cryptographic correctness, security review or App Store availability.
- Never store or publish OTP seeds, backup codes, signing secrets, issuer metadata or real QR enrollment payloads.

## Start here

1. Review [the disclaimer](DISCLAIMER.md) and [implementation notes](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md).
2. Replace placeholder screenshots only with approved, anonymized visuals.
3. Confirm platform support, and enable approved public demo links only after independent testing.
4. Publish as a distinct public repository; **never mirror, fork or reveal original private projects**.
5. Add the public showcase URL to the Projects section of [portfolio.jelvan.pro](https://portfolio.jelvan.pro) without making production URLs visible in the viewer.
